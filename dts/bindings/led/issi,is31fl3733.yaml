properties:
  sdb-gpios:
    type: phandle-array
    description: |
      Hardware shutdown pin. If routed on the board, this property must be
      present. Set to a logical 1 at boot to exit the device from hardware
      shutdown.
  current-limit:
    type: int
    default: 0xFF
    description: |
      Global current limit. Sets the global current control register of LED
      driver (set table 14). Limits global current based on the following
      formula: (840/R_ISET) * (current-limit/256). Defaults to max value
      of 0xFF, so led output will still be enabled if property is
      not provided.
  default-brightness:
    type: int
    default: 0xFF
    description: |
      This property allows the user to set LED brightness at boot, so
      that when an LED is enabled by the user it will have a preset
      brightness. If this setting is set to 0, LEDs will need to have
      a defined brightness set via the led_set_brightness API before
      they will illuminate. Defaults to maximum brightness of 0xFF.
  sync-mode:
    type: string
    default: "high-z"
    enum:
      - "high-z"
      - "master"
      - "slave"
    description: |
      This property configures the LED controller as a master or slave
      clock device. This can be used to synchronize the output of multiple
      LED controllers. See SYNC bits in led configuration register for more
      information.
